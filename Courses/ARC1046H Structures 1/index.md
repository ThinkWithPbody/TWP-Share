#### Structure
#### Strength
The amount of load a structure can sustain prior to failure.

Load on the system has to be less than the load capacity of the system that sustains load. 
##### Load factor

**Factor of safety** of 2: the system can sustain twice the load expected.

Pf: factor of load
Vf: factor of shear
Mf: factor of moment
Tf: 

##### Capacity reduced

Pr: resistance of load
Vr: resistance of shear
Mr: resistance of moment

##### Types of forces
###### Compression
Always a secondary factor resulting tension failure.
###### Tension
###### Shear
On concrete, itâ€™s a tension failure on the diagonal.
*Concrete Punching Shear*
###### Bending
Compression and Tension acting on either sides, a tension failure on the tension side.
Steel beam fails by yielding both in compression and tension.
###### Torsion
Shear around the perimeter. 
###### Moment
Distance moved * force = 1 kNm = 1,000,000 Nmm
###### Connection Failures
- Screws shearing, bending.
- Plate in tension.
- Anchor pullout

#### Stiffness
The amount of force required to make a structure deflect by some fixed increment. 
Represented by symbol **K**.
Flexibility is the amount that a structure will deflect or rotate under a fixed amount of load.

**Guidelines**
- Comfort
- Preservation of Finishes
- Stability
- Drainage
- Interface with Building Elements

**Serviceability Limit**
[SERVICEABILITY LIMITS.pdf](file:///D:%5COneDrive%20-%20University%20of%20Toronto%5C_twp%5CDocument%5CScholar%5CUTOR%5C2024-01%5CARC1046H%5CFiles%5CReadings%5CSERVICEABILITY%20LIMITS.pdf)

**Vertical**
- Live: L/360
- Total: L/240

**Horizontal**
- H/500

**Rotational**

**Soil**
Differential settlement

**Vibration**
Continuous vibrations
- 2.5 Hz

Transient vibrations
- Heel drop
- Load is damped by mass of building and 
- Limit the acceleration to 1% of gravity

Amplified vibrations (resonance)


#### Stability
The state of being stable, or the opposite of in-stable. Instability can be elastic, ponding, tipping, or sliding. 

**Sliding**
- Resistance by friction

**Tipping**

**Elastic**
- Stable
	- Columns converge on a limit visually straight
- Unstable
	- Not stiff enough causing more and more elastic instability

**Ponding**
- Stable
- Unstable
	- More sagging allows accumulation of more water causing more sagging

**No load path**

**Buckling**
- **Overall**
- **Lateral torsional**
- **Local**
	- Instability resulting from a compressive load
